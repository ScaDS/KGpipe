          1) contains at least `samples_n` triples for *each* predicate in `graph`,

        -----
        - This is a greedy heuristic (the exact problem is NP-hard).

        - If a chosen triple would make closure impossible (object with no
          outgoing triples), we backtrack on that triple and try alternatives.
        - If a predicate has fewer than `samples_n` triples in the original
